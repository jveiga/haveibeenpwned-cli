# pwned

CLI to check if a password has been found in [haveibeenpwned.com/](haveibeenpwned.com)

Note that the way the passwords api works, only the first 5 characters of a password are sent to haveibeenpwned.com
and not the full hash.
Check https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords and the code.
